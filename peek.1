.SH NAME
peek - The simple cheatsheet handler
.SH SYNOPSIS
peek [ -h ][ -l ][ -e file ][ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
peek is a simple cheatsheet handler for 
your personal cheatsheets. Just use it for your
daily system administration tasks, to take a
peek out of your favourite one-liners or anything
else that you use often but not so often to
remember. It is able to open your cheatsheets just
for reading or for edit. Your cheatsheets do not need
any special syntax; they are just regular text files.
If no option is passed to peek but a filename, peek
searches in the CHEATSHEET_DIR to open it. See
peek.h if you want to set it to another directory. If
the cheatsheet does not exist, peek shouts an
error. If the file has a lot of lines, a pager
like less(1) can be used to ease your tasks.
See Examples.
