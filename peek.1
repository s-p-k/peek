.SH NAME
peek \- The simple cheatsheet handler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B peek [ -h ][ -e file ][ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
peek is a simple cheatsheet handler. You can use it for your daily system
administration tasks, to read/take some brief notes, to take a peek out of your
favourite one-liners or anything else that you use often but not so often to
remember.
.br

If no option is passed to peek but a filename, peek searches in the
CHEATSHEET_DIR to open it. Edit config.h to match your CHEATSHEET_DIR. If the
cheatsheet does not exist, peek informs the user with an error. If the file has
a lot of lines, a pager like less(1) can be used to ease your tasks.
.br

No back up function exists since the text editor should handle your backups. An
editor like mg or vim should work like a charm. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Show the help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-e

.TP

peek tar

2. Open tar cheatsheet for edit (or creation) and when
done exit succesfully:
