This is the behaviour peek should have
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ peek tar	# this should check for a cheatsheet named tar in the default
		# cheatsheet directory. This is half-done:
		# i need to just set a default dir and open the file readonly
		# peek /home/user/csdir/tar works fine.

$ peek -e tar	# open tar cheatsheet for edit with $EDITOR. To avoid atomicity,
       	# i should copy tar to a tmp file, edit it and then rename it
	    	# with rename() so that i either have the "old" or the new
		# version of the cheatsheet.

If all the above are finished, optionally i could add -d option to search a
cheatsheet in a different directory from the default with something like:

$ peek tar -d /another/directory/

TODO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function to open a file with EDITOR when peek is ran with -e option
