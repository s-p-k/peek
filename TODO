This is the behaviour peek should have
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ peek tar	# this should check for a cheatsheet named tar in the default
		# cheatsheet directory. This is half-done:
		# i need to just set a default dir and open the file readonly
		# peek /home/user/csdir/tar works fine.

$ peek -e tar	# open tar cheatsheet for edit with $EDITOR. To avoid atomicity,
	       	# i should copy tar to a tmp file, edit it and then rename it
	    	# with rename() so that i either have the "old" or the new
		# version of the cheatsheet.

TODO

Write a function to open a file with EDITOR when peek is ran with -e option.
The function should open a copy of the file indicated with the -e option.

Write a function to list all available cheatsheets in CHEATSHEET_DIR
