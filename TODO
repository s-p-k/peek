--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the behaviour peek should have
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ peek tar	# this should check for a cheatsheet named tar in the default
		# cheatsheet directory. Could be combined with less if the
		# file has a lot of lines

$ peek -e tar	# open tar cheatsheet for edit with $EDITOR

$ peek -h	# show usage examples

$ peek -v	# show version

If all the above are finished, optionally i could add -d option to search a
cheatsheet in a different directory from the default with something like:

$ peek tar -d /another/directory/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Write a function to read the files in the DEF_DIR

2. Write a function to open a file with EDITOR when peek is ran with -e option

3. Replace stat with open to check if a file exists
