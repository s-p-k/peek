peek 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Peek is a simple cheatsheet handler.

Configuring peek:

1. Supposing you want to configure peek with mg, open peek.c with your
favourite editor and make the following changes:


	CHEATSHEETDIR "/home/your-user/.peek/"

	EDITOR "/usr/bin/mg"

	BIN_NAME "mg"

	CHEATSHEETDIR is the directory where your cheatsheets are stored:
	change according to your tastes.

	EDITOR: where your editor's binary lives.

	BIN_NAME: the name of your editor.
	
If you want to use vim instead, replace mg with vim, change CHEATSHEETDIR and
make sure ~/.peek exists.

2. Save it.

3. I will soon add a Makefile, until then just build with gcc with something
like:

gcc -Wall -Wextra peek.c -o peek
