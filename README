peek 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Peek is a simple cheatsheet handler.

Configuring peek:

1. peek used by default your $EDITOR, if $EDITOR is not set, it uses /usr/bin/vi

	CHEATSHEETDIR "/home/your-user/.peek/"

	CHEATSHEETDIR is the directory where your cheatsheets are stored:
	edit peek.c according to your tastes.

2. I will soon add a Makefile, until then just build with gcc with something
like:

gcc -Wall -Wextra peek.c -o peek
