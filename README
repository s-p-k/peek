--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Peek is a simple cheatsheet handler.

Configuring peek:

1. Supposing you want to configure peek with mg, open peek.c with your
favourite editor and make the following changes:


	CHEATSHEETDIR "/home/your-user/.peek/"

	
make sure ~/.peek exists.

2. Save it.

3. I will soon add a Makefile, until then just build with gcc with something
like:

gcc -Wall -Wextra peek.c -o peek

4. You can get a sample of cheatheets here:

https://github.com/s-p-k/cheatsheets

Just copy them on your ~/.peek/ directory.
